# N_Questions_Game
C implementation of the 20 Questions Game using Decision Trees.
##Input File Format
####The M-Questions game will get information about what questions to ask, the items, and the answer to each question for each item, from a database file that is formatted similarly to a CSV file. working directory. Here is one example of a file that the program will be expected to read in:
```
10
does it have 4 legs?,does it have wheels?,does it have a motor?,does it have fur?
car,0,1,1,0
fox,1,0,0,1
elephant,1,0,0,0
trailer,0,1,0,0
tarantula,0,0,0,1
mirror,0,0,0,0
work bench,1,1,0,0
standing desk,1,1,1,0
bear,1,0,0,1
lion,1,0,0,1
```

* The first line should be a number, which tells the program how many total items this file has in it. In the
example above, there are 10 total items: car, fox, elephant, trailer, tarantula, mirror, work bench,
standing desk, bear, lion.
* The second line will have a comma-separated list of the questions that this file has information about. In
the example above, there are four questions.
* From the third line on, each line will have information about one item in a comma-separated list. The first element will be the name of the item. For example, the item car is on line 3. Following this is a comma separated list of 1s and 0s. A 1 corresponds to a “yes” answer to a question, and a 0 corresponds to “no”. For example, for the car row, the numbers are 0,1,1,0. This means that the answerto the first and fourth questions from row 2 are “no” and the answer to the second and third questions from row 2 are “yes”. This makes sense, because a card does NOT have 4 legs and does NOT havefur, but it DOES have four wheels and it DOES have a motor.Of course, this is just one example. The number of items and questions may vary. The program should support *any* number of items and questions. The game should support any number of questions.The database file should be provided as the first command-line argument to the program. For example, if the contents of that file were stored in a file named small.mq then you should run the game with this file like so:
```
$ ./game small.mq
```
